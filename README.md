# Baseball MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for retrieving baseball information using the [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) library.

> Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and FanGraphs so you don't have to.

## Overview

This MCP server provides access to comprehensive baseball data through a standardized interface. It leverages the `pybaseball` library to fetch statistics, game information, and player data from various baseball databases.

The primary purpose is to make baseball analysis easy, with a particular focus on fantasy baseball.

## Features

- Player statistics retrieval
- Team performance data  
- Game schedules and results
- Statcast pitch-by-pitch data
- League standings
- Player comparison tools
- Game logs for players and teams
- Sabermetric similarity scoring
- Ballpark factor analysis
- MCP Resources for comprehensive data packages
- SQLite caching for performance
- Both STDIO and HTTP server transports

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linell/baseball-mcp.git
cd baseball-mcp
```

2. Install the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or for development:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Running the Server

Run the STDIO server (default):
```bash
baseball-mcp run
```

Run the HTTP server on port 3000:
```bash
baseball-mcp http --port 3000
```

Reset the on-disk cache:
```bash
baseball-mcp cache-reset --confirm
```

Check server health:
```bash
baseball-mcp health
```

### Example Usage

- "Get Mike Trout's 2023 stats" → uses `get_player_stats`
- "Show me the Yankees' 2024 team statistics" → uses `get_team_stats`  
- "What's the Padres' schedule for March 2025?" → uses `get_schedule`
- "Get Statcast data for Aaron Judge from June 1-7, 2024" → uses `get_statcast`
- "Show me the 2024 AL East standings" → uses `get_standings`
- "Compare Mike Trout and Aaron Judge's 2024 stats" → uses `compare_players`

### Team Abbreviations

The server supports various team abbreviations for convenience:

- **San Diego Padres**: `SD` or `SDP`
- **San Francisco Giants**: `SF` or `SFG`
- **Tampa Bay Rays**: `TB` or `TBR`
- **Kansas City Royals**: `KC` or `KCR`
- **Chicago White Sox**: `CWS` or `CHW`
- **Washington Nationals**: `WSH` or `WSN`

For a complete list, use the `list_team_abbreviations` tool.

## Deployment

This MCP server can be deployed to services like [Smithery](https://smithery.ai) or any container platform.

### Configuration

The server supports the following configuration options via query parameters:

- `cache_reset` (boolean): Whether to reset the cache on startup
- `log_level` (string): Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- `max_results` (integer): Maximum number of results to return (1-1000)

Example: `GET /mcp?cache_reset=false&log_level=INFO&max_results=100`

### Local Testing

Test the HTTP server locally:

```bash
# Start the server
baseball-mcp http --port 3000

# Test the MCP endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}},"id":1}'

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Development

### Setting up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Code Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff**: Linting and code analysis
- **MyPy**: Type checking
- **Pre-commit**: Git hooks for code quality

Run all checks:
```bash
black src tests
ruff check src tests
mypy src
```

## Configuration

### Cache

The server uses SQLite for caching baseball data to improve performance and reduce API calls.

- **Default location**: `~/.config/baseball-mcp/baseball.db`
- **Management**: Data is automatically cached when first requested
- **Reset**: Use `baseball-mcp cache-reset --confirm` to clear all cached data

### Server Modes

- **STDIO Mode** (default): Runs as an MCP server for local AI clients
- **HTTP Mode**: Runs as an HTTP server for remote access (`baseball-mcp http --port 8000`)
